# /wrap

You are executing the session wrap command.

## What to Do

1. Summarize what was accomplished this session
2. Record any key decisions made to `state/decisions.md`
3. Update task state: if `.planning/STATE.md` exists, update it with current progress; also update `tasks/todo.md` with a Session Handoff section
4. Append a session entry to `state/session-log.md`
5. Check `.planning/` for any GSD state files (milestones, phases, notes) and ensure they reflect session outcomes
6. Note any next steps or blockers for the next session

## Session Log Entry Format

```markdown

```
